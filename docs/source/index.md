Documentation for mushroomclassification

Aim:
* This project aims to classify mushrooms into 4 safety categories: Edible, Conditionally Edible, Poisonous and Deadly. We aim to build a pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, deployment and evaluation.

Problem Statement:
There exists a multitude of mushrooms in the nature many of which are either toxic or harmful to humans. The main challenge in identifying the poisonous and non-poisonous mushrooms are the visual similarities between them. This project provides an automated solution to identify mushroom safety categories to mitiagte health risks and avoid any accidental posioning.
 
Key features:
* -Data preprocessing using Albumentations
* -Model training with pyTorch Lightning
* -Deployment-ready API

Goals:
- Performning dvc and preprocessing for the data we use
- Training a CNN model which predicst the safety level of mushrooms
- build a pipeline which streamlines the task needed.
