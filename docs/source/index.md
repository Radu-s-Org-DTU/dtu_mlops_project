Documentation for mushroomclassification

Introduction:
This project aims to classify a mushrooms 
 
Key features:
-Data preprocessing using Albumentations
-Model training with pyTorch Lightning
-Deployment-ready API

Goals:
- Performning dvc and preprocessing for the data we use
- Training a CNN model which predicst the safety level of mushrooms
- build a pipeline which streamlines the task needed.
