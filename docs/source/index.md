Documentation for mushroomclassification

Aim:
* This project aims to classify mushrooms into 4 safety categories: Edible, Conditionally Edible, Poisonous and Deadly. We aim to build a pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, deployment and evaluation. 
 
Key features:
-Data preprocessing using Albumentations
-Model training with pyTorch Lightning
-Deployment-ready API

Goals:
- Performning dvc and preprocessing for the data we use
- Training a CNN model which predicst the safety level of mushrooms
- build a pipeline which streamlines the task needed.
