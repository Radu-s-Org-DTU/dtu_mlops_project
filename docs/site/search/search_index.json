We aim to build a pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, deployment and evaluation.</p> <p>Problem Statement: - There exists a multitude of mushrooms in the nature many of which are either toxic or harmful to humans. The main challenge in identifying the poisonous and non-poisonous mushrooms are the visual similarities between them. This project provides an automated solution to identify mushroom safety categories to mitiagte health risks and avoid any accidental posioning.</p> <p>Key features: - Data preprocessing using Albumentations   * Images are transformed using Albumentations library where the transformations applied are re-sizing the images and rotating it. - Model training with pyTorch Lightning   * - Deployment-ready API   * API for real time interface built using FastAPI   * Dockerized environment for seamless deployment on cloud platform GCP. - Version control    * Data versioning done using DVC    * CI/CD workflows implemented using Github</p> <p>Goals: - Performning dvc and preprocessing for the data we use - Training a CNN model which predicst the safety level of mushrooms - build a pipeline which streamlines the task needed.</p> <p>Dataset Structure: - The dataset is sourced from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zedsden/mushroom-classification-dataset/data - Raw data is stored in data/raw directory containing unprocessed images. - The data is augmented and resized at runtime and is not stored. (So, Processed data folder is empty)</p>"}]}
